Hot Water by Sunshine
=====================

About six months ago, I started wondering if there was something useful I could
do with all the sunshine we get here in Colorado. I knew that photovoltaic solar
panels were expensive and could take a long time to pay for themselves; was
there an alternative approach that would require a minimal initial investment,
and had better potential for a return on that investment?

I soon discovered the Build-It-Solar_ website, a fantastic resource for any
DIYer looking to save some money while conserving energy and reducing their
environmental footprint. One of the most intriguing ideas I found there was a
solar water heater, specifically Gary Reysa's `$1K water heating system`_. I
spent several months thinking about building one, determining how big it would
need to be, what materials I would need, and how much it would cost.

This summer, I finally got around to doing it. This project documents what I
learned, including photos of the work in progress as well as the final result.
