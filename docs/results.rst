Getting Results
===============

I started seeing some positive results after only a few days of using my new
solar water heater. There were some partly cloudy days, and I had some minor
glitches with the pump, but by logging the tank and collector temperature I
could see it was definitely working.

- **Day 1**: The storage tank started the day at 65 degrees F, and had climbed
  up to 80 F by the evening. 15 degrees doesn't seem like much, but when you
  consider there are 1200 pounds of water to heat up, that equates to about
  18,000 BTU, or about 5 KWH of electricity.
- **Day 2**: The tank temperature was about 79.5 F in the morning, so the
  tank didn't lose more than 0.5 degree overnight. It dropped by another 0.5
  degree to supply water for two showers in the morning. By the end of the day,
  the tnk temperature was back up to 96 F, meaning we got about 20,000 BTU from
  the sun on day 2.
- **Day 3**: Overnight losses plus hot showers dropped the tank temperature to
  about 94 F. Mostly cloudy today; the pump turned on for a while, but I
  manually shut it off because the tank was only getting cooler. It was at about
  92 F in the early afternoon when I stopped logging.
